# Cody's game
Get a flying start with CODY

## Concept
Create a relevant game with Cody as the game character.
Inspiration:
* SuperMario / Donkey Kong
* Flappy Bird

Cody is on a mission to collect data. 
He is flying over the ocean, and collets data from: 
* ships
* smaller boats
* satellites
* oil platforms

Things Cody should avoid: 
* Old technology
* Yelling managers

OR A level is a ship, another is a oil platform, yet another is a factory.
